# URL Hit Counter

This program is designed to count the number of times a URL has been hit without the use of any database. This program uses Maven and Java to create a simple command-line application.

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt: `java -jar target/URL-Hit-Counter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar [URL]`
